# Lottery Ball Physics Simulator

A simple physics-based simulation of an air-mix lottery drawing system.

## Description

This project simulates the physical behavior of lottery balls in an air-mix drawing machine. It aims to replicate the random mixing and selection process used in official lottery drawings.

## Features

- Real-time physics simulation of bouncing lottery balls
- Air turbulence effects
- Ball selection mechanism
- Realistic ball collision physics
- Configurable number of balls and drawing parameters

## Technologies

- Physics engine
- Graphics rendering system
- Random number generation
- Collision detection algorithms

## Usage

1. Configure the number of balls
2. Start the simulation
3. Watch the balls mix in real-time
4. View the selected numbers
